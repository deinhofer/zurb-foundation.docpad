### Component Description

Commonly web sites are only adapted by static context parameters (screen size), preference sets or location information. The module adds the possibility to classify the user context during the browsing based on the acceleration of the smart phone.

jActivity uses the two HTML5 events \`DeviceMotion\` and \`DeviceOrientation\`. The corresponding specifications can be found here: [DeviceOrientation Event Specification (W3C Working Draft)](http://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/ "http://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/").

The underlying learning system is the start of a reimplementation of the underlying actiServ system ([http://www.teco.edu/\~berch/publications/ISWC10](http://www.teco.edu/~berch/publications/ISWC10 "http://www.teco.edu/~berch/publications/ISWC10")) using open source components. It currently supports only simple single user training.

### Potential Applications

The system can be used to adapt the font size during different activities

if getDecisionOfDT([... insert calculated features here ...]) == “Gehen”) { makeFontSizeBigger(); } else { makeFontSizeSmaller(); }

### Technologies

The system uses HTML5 Device Orientation events ([http://caniuse.com/deviceorientation,](http://caniuse.com/deviceorientation, "http://caniuse.com/deviceorientation,") or any other kind of scalar sensor input )

It is currently implemented using php on the server side.

It further uses [http://scikit-learn.org/](http://scikit-learn.org/ "http://scikit-learn.org/") for training the classifiers.

The client side generated by the server runs as javascript in the web browser.

### Licence Information

MIT Licence

See [https://github.com/teco-kit/jActivity/blob/master/LICENSE](https://github.com/teco-kit/jActivity/blob/master/LICENSE "https://github.com/teco-kit/jActivity/blob/master/LICENSE") for more Info

### Status, Known Issues & Planned Work

The generalization and personalization features for classifiers need to be ported from the proprietary Matlab code.

More classifiers need to be implemented in javascript.
